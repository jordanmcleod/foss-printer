# foss-printer

Physical printers are still a necessary evil but we do not yet have a FOSS-aligned alternative.  This project seeks to design, source, and build a physical printer with FOSS fundamentals that use purpose-built FOSS that should be adaptable to any OS so that anyone can build a printer with fully transparent operations with re-usable (and re-fillable) ink cartridges to reduce e-waste.

The intial phases of this project will be to design a printer using parts that can readily be obtained using a variety of controllers to allow anyone, worldwide to build a printer from modular components.  Using modular components should also benefit the reduction of e-waste by allowing the components of the printer to be re-used in other projects if the printer is no longer required (or is made sufficiently obsolete by the community maintaining this project).

Presently, this project will be split into the following paths:

## foss-printer/hardware
- hardware design and schematics
- research of components
  - controllers
  - print system
    - jet 
    - laser 
    - phaser (wax) 
    - thermal

## foss-printer/software
- drivers
- GUI

## foss-printer/media
- research of print medium
  - liquid ink
    - viscosity
    - pigment colors
  - powdered ink
    - particle sizes
    - pigment colors
  - wax blocks
    - composition
    - sizes
