# foss-printer
Physical printers are still a necessary evil but we do not yet have a FOSS alternative.  This project seeks to design, source, and build a print with FOSS fundamentals so that anyone can build a printer with fully transparent operations with re-usable ink cartridges to reduce e-waste.
